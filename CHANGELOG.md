# Changelog

All notable changes to MiBee-Rec are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Meeting mode** (SPEC appendix A #27): on-demand local meeting
  minutes — explicit `POST /api/meetings/start` → `stop` recording
  sessions (nothing is recorded outside a session; WAV deleted after
  processing unless `meeting.keep_audio`), then offline speaker
  diarization (pyannote segmentation + CAM++ embedding + fast
  clustering) → per-segment trilingual ASR → punctuation restoration →
  per-speaker voiceprint voting for names. New endpoints
  `GET/DELETE /api/meetings`, `GET /api/meetings/{id}`; new SSE
  `meeting_state`; new tables `meeting_records` + `meeting_segments`
  (migration 007); capability `meeting`; auto-stop at
  `max_duration_secs`; `--selftest-meeting <wav>` diarization
  self-test. Records view gains a meeting-minutes card.
- **Speaker voiceprints** (SPEC appendix A #25): enroll wake-word
  voiceprints (3D-Speaker CAM++ via sherpa-onnx, zh_en checkpoint),
  gate wake words on a known speaker (`voice.speaker_verify`, fail-open
  without profiles), and attribute voice hearing records / SSE
  `voice_transcript` to the best-matching speaker. New endpoints
  `GET/POST /api/voice/speakers`, `POST …/commit`, `POST …/cancel`,
  `DELETE …/{name}`; new table `voice_speakers` (migration 006) +
  `hearing_records.speaker` column; Records view gains a speakers card
  and speaker badges. Verified end-to-end acoustically on the
  workstation (enroll → gate pass → tagging → stranger rejection).
- **Trilingual ASR** (Cantonese / Mandarin / English): the optional
  `sherpa-onnx-paraformer-trilingual-zh-cantonese-en` checkpoint
  (234MB int8, Apache-2.0) drops into `[voice] paraformer_model` —
  verified on Cantonese and mixed zh-en samples.
- **Voice decision assist** (SPEC appendix A #26): `[decision]` section
  runs Laya typed decisions (multilingual ONNX, Apache-2.0) over each
  transcript before the local LLM answers; `ignore` skips the reply,
  decisions ride a new `voice_decision` SSE event. Fail-open below
  `min_confidence` or without models.

### Fixed

- Voice enrollment no longer collects samples past `needed` (extra wake
  words between completion and commit were inflating the count — caught
  by the workstation acoustic E2E).

- **Sound events, tracking + zones, OCR** (SPEC appendix A #21): constant
  microphone listening with YAMNet classification (3-vote smoothing,
  per-class cooldown, Silero-VAD voice presence) emitting `source: "audio"`
  alarms; a ByteTrack-subset tracker over the visual detections with
  user-drawn intrusion/tripwire zones (`GET/PUT /api/cameras/{id}/zones`,
  `zone_event` SSE); PP-OCR v4/v5 text recognition (`POST /api/ocr`). All
  opt-in `[audio_ai]` / `[ocr]` config, fail-open.
- **Voice interaction closed loop** (SPEC appendix A #22): wake word 小蜜蜂
  (sherpa-onnx zipformer KWS) → `capture_secs` of audio → offline
  paraformer zh transcription (`voice_transcript` SSE) → local LLM reply
  (`chat_reply` SSE) → TTS playback via the `sherpa-onnx-offline-tts` CLI
  subprocess (GPL espeak-ng isolated outside this binary). Requires the
  `voice` cargo feature; opt-in `[voice]` / `[llm]` / `[tts]` config.
- **Local LLM dialogue**: `POST /api/chat` (`{"text","history"}` →
  `{"reply"}`) plus the web chat panel, llama.cpp + Qwen3 GGUF, greedy
  decoding with `/no_think`.
- **Alarm-frame descriptions** (SPEC appendix A #23): Qwen3-VL (llama.cpp
  mtmd) describes the triggering JPEG of each accepted visual alarm —
  asynchronous `alarm_description` SSE that never delays the alarm;
  single-flight scheduler with a 120 s inter-description floor so flapping
  detectors cannot stack inference. Opt-in `[vlm]` config, `llm` feature,
  memory guardrail before load.
- `--selftest-audio/-ocr/-voice/-llm/-tts/-vlm` offline one-shot CLI
  self-tests (JSON result per engine) and `models/README.md` documenting the
  untracked model assets.
- Documentation: new bilingual **User Guide** (`docs/{en,zh}/user-guide.md`)
  and on-device-intelligence sections across configuration / API /
  architecture / installation / getting-started docs and both READMEs.

### Changed

- Inference thread pools are auto-capped (`OMP_NUM_THREADS` = cores/2, max 4)
  unless the environment sets it; llama.cpp is linked with minimal features
  (its `common`/`android-shared-stdcxx` features abort at static init when
  sherpa-onnx is also linked).
- ALSA capture requests a 2048-frame period clamped to the device range —
  eliminates xruns on small laptop codecs when inference threads preempt the
  audio callback.

### Fixed

- **Hearing dead for a whole run after one lost monitor build**: the audio
  monitor is now opened with a bounded retry (3 s × 10) at startup, and when
  the device rejects the widened 2048-frame period (PipeWire-era ALSA
  plugins enforce the current quantum — observed `341..=342` frames), the
  monitor falls back to the device default instead of pausing sound events
  and the wake word until the next restart. Full error chains are logged.
- llama-cpp-2 batch-relative logits indexing (prompt decode vs generation
  step); `«think»` blocks stripped from replies; one shared llama.cpp
  backend instance instead of per-engine loads.
- Zones PUT accepts the bare zone array the API contract specifies (the
  shared frontend sent a wrapped object; mock leniency had masked it).
- CI feature matrix covers `no-ai` / `voice` / `llm` / `voice+llm` / `vlm`
  builds (vlm-gated mtmd code and audio_ai no-ai hygiene regressions).

## [0.4.0] — 2026-09-27

- **Low-resolution bandwidth-saving substream** (SPEC appendix A #20,
  default off): per-camera `config.substream` `{enabled, width, height,
  fps, bitrate}` (defaults 640x360 / 400 kbps / fps 0 = follow) adds a
  second OpenH264 encoder session fed by the downscaled, already
  rotated/flipped/watermarked frames — a bounded-tap design that never
  stalls the main pipeline (encoder init failure disables the substream
  for the run, fail-open). Exposed as `GET
  /api/cameras/{id}/stream.sub.mse` (+ `capabilities.substream` while
  any active stream runs a substream), the RTSP `/live/{id}/sub` mount
  (`find_live_stream` now resolves longest-match-wins so the sub mount
  can never be captured by the shorter main path) and the ONVIF `sub`
  profile (onvif-device-rs multi-profile, git pin 1826726; advertised
  after the primary; applies on the next protocol toggle). Structural
  validation at the PUT boundary (even dims, sane bitrate) and at stream
  start; applies on stream (re)start like the other per-camera keys.
  `encoder::convert::Yuv420p::downscaled` is the new nearest-neighbour
  scaler (twin of the rs/go implementations).
- **Device-level rotation baked into the stream** (SPEC v1 appendix A
  #19): per-camera `config.rotation` (0 | 90 | 180 | 270, clockwise
  degrees) rotates the frames before encoding — every consumer (RTSP,
  MSE, recordings, snapshots, AI) sees it, and 90/270 swap the stream
  geometry (encoder config + published `StreamDimensions`, so the MP4
  muxer matches). Applied before `hflip`/`vflip`; 180° folds into the
  flip pass. Takes effect on stream (re)start like the flips — the web
  UI camera card gains a rotation button that cycles 0→90→180→270 with
  the same stop→start cycle (webui PR #11). `PUT /api/cameras/{id}`
  rejects invalid values with 400; the MJPEG passthrough tap is disabled
  while rotated (re-encodes from the rotated YUV).
- **Device serial identity** (issue #18): an unset
  `protocols.onvif.serial` no longer reports the shared `NC00000001`
  default — explicit config wins, otherwise the device identity is
  probed (cpuinfo `Serial` / Linux machine-id, cached for the process
  lifetime); the shared default is the last resort with a warning. Two
  distinct installs can no longer collapse into one NVR stable_id.
- **ONVIF Pull-Point events service** (onvif-device-rs 0.7): AI motion
  alarms now also publish as `tns1:VideoSource/MotionAlarm` (Source =
  the camera UUID) while an NVR holds a pull-point subscription — the
  same accepted rising edge that feeds the GB alarm NOTIFY and the
  SPEC v1 §6 `alarm` SSE event. New `protocols.onvif.events_enabled`
  key (default `true`, absent DB rows parse as enabled; protocol
  re-toggle applies). The `alarm` SSE event is now advertised with AI
  active instead of requiring a running GB28181 protocol — each alarm
  channel no-ops independently until its consumer is up/subscribed.- **Device-level rotation** baked into the stream (SPEC appendix A #19),
  with the 180° fold pinned by frame-level regression tests.
- **Talkback upstream** (GB/T 28181 §9.2 send half): microphone audio to
  the platform as G.711 A-law, following the negotiated law (PCMU) per
  session; **voice broadcast receive** completes full-duplex talk.
- **Seamless MSE reconnect**: the live timeline continues across
  connection drops (SPEC §4.1).
- **ONVIF**: AI motion alarms as Pull-Point MotionAlarm events; unset
  device serial no longer reports the shared NC00000001 identity.
- **Fail-open audio device list**: `/api/devices/audio` degrades to an
  empty list when the host cannot enumerate inputs (a user service
  without audio-device access), and per-device config rows are capped —
  the previous multi-megabyte dump was silently 500'd by the response
  envelope middleware, which now fails loudly instead.
- **AI model panel fixed**: the model select rendered empty and the
  upload button stayed hidden (request wrapper passed instead of the
  unwrapped payload).
- Security dependency refresh: onvif-device-rs quick-xml 0.41
  (RUSTSEC-2026-0194/0195), h2 / rustls / crossbeam updates.
- Shared frontend: explicit username login field, alarm toasts, mobile
  toolbar wrap, live-view rotate button, substream quality toggle.

Synchronized with [mibee-eye-go](https://github.com/xiqing85/mibee-eye-go/releases/tag/v0.4.0) and [mibee-eye-rs](https://github.com/xiqing85/mibee-eye-rs/releases/tag/v0.4.0) (same version, same day).
## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-16

Late join to the v0.3.0 train (user decision): the version number aligns
with the raspi twins, whose synchronized v0.3.0 shipped the
GB/T 28181-2022 device-role full coverage. This release brings the
notebook to the same device surface and takes one observation seam
further.

### Added — GB28181 device-surface parity with the raspi twins (v0.3.0 train)

- **FrameMirror (DeviceConfig A.2.3.2.9)**: the platform's runtime mirror
  mode (0-3 per A.2.1.22) now flips every camera's frames — implemented
  as device-level atomic flags shared by all capture loops and
  XOR-composed with each camera's static `hflip`/`vflip` mount
  compensation (two same-axis mirrors cancel). Baked into everything
  downstream: encoder (RTSP/MSE/recordings/GB28181), snapshots and the
  JPEG tap (MJPEG passthrough correctly disabled while mirroring).
  BasicParam keeps the reject posture, matching the raspi twins.
- **SIP-Date drift observation (§9.10.2)**: the platform clock from
  REGISTER response `Date` headers is polled once a minute; drift beyond
  5s WARNs (first excursion and every further 5s move; recovery logs
  once). Observation only — the system clock is never adjusted by the
  app. Ahead of the raspi twins, which expose the library seam but do
  not observe it yet.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-16

### Changed — Brand rename to `mibee-eye` (family-wide packaging convention)

The product/binary/service name is now **`mibee-eye`**, aligning with the
MiBee Eye packaging convention (the Raspberry Pi Go twin ships the same
binary name). The repository stays `mibee-eye-notebook`.

- Cargo package and binary: `mibee-rec` → `mibee-eye`
- systemd unit: `mibee-rec.service` → `mibee-eye.service` (binary path
  `/usr/local/bin/mibee-eye`, `User=mibee-eye`, `StateDirectory=mibee-eye`)
- Default database file: `mibee_rec.db` → `mibee_eye.db` (clap default and
  the XDG default `~/.local/share/mibee-eye/mibee_eye.db`)
- Prometheus metric prefix: `mibee_rec_*` → `mibee_eye_*`
  (**breaking for dashboards** — update your queries)
- TLS dev certificate identity: `CN=mibee-rec` / `SAN=mibee-rec.local` →
  `CN=mibee-eye` / `SAN=mibee-eye.local`
- RTSP realm (`mibee-eye RTSP Server`) and `Server` header; RTSP SDP
  session name; GB28181 SIP `User-Agent: mibee-eye/<version>`; ONVIF
  default `device_name`; OpenTelemetry service name; capabilities
  `device.name`
- Docker: paths `/usr/local/share/mibee-eye`, `/var/lib/mibee-eye`, image
  user `mibee-eye`; container migration search path updated accordingly

**Migration steps:**
1. Rename the database before upgrading (stop the service first, WAL
   files included): `mv mibee_rec.db* mibee_eye.db*` — or keep the old
   path by passing `--db-path` explicitly.
2. Update Prometheus/Grafana queries referencing `mibee_rec_*` metrics.
3. Delete `tls/cert.pem` and `tls/key.pem` before restarting (new
   identity is regenerated automatically); old certificates keep working
   until then.
4. If using systemd: install `mibee-eye.service` and
   `systemctl disable --now mibee-rec.service` first.
5. If using Docker: update container name and volume paths from
   `mibee-rec` to `mibee-eye`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-16

First public release (Apache-2.0), open-sourced as
[mibee-eye-notebook](https://github.com/xiqing85/mibee-eye-notebook) — the
notebook/desktop member of the MiBee Eye camera family. The sections below
cover the final stretch of the pre-open-source line, most recently the
unified SPEC v1 web API with the shared web UI and the GB28181-2022
device-surface parity batch.

### Added — GB28181-2022 device-surface parity with the raspi twins

- **Alarm pipeline**: AI detection rising edges fire the SPEC v1 §6
  `alarm` SSE event and a GB28181 Alarm NOTIFY (priority 4 / method 5 /
  type 2, 2022 standard table) through the gb28181-rs notifier seam;
  per-camera rising-edge cooldown (`alarm_cooldown_secs`, default 30)
  and runtime gate from the platform's DeviceConfig AlarmReport switches
  (`alarm_notify_enabled` initial value).
- **DeviceControl family**: IFrameCmd forces the next OpenH264-encoded
  frame to an IDR; RecordCmd gates local recording (the current MP4
  segment closes on pause, the next keyframe reopens); no-actuator
  commands (PTZ/Guard/TeleBoot/HomePosition/DragZoom) ack as no-ops.
- **Graceful deregistration**: SIGTERM / protocol stop sends REGISTER
  `Expires: 0` (library 401 dance, 2s timeouts) before teardown.
- **MobilePosition**: static coordinates
  (`position_longitude` / `position_latitude`, empty = off) reported on
  the subscription cadence.

### Changed — Unified Web API SPEC v1 + shared web UI

**Breaking** (web API): the REST surface now follows the MiBee camera
unified SPEC v1 (`mibee-webui/SPEC.md`), same contract as the Raspberry Pi
camera projects:

- All JSON responses enveloped: `{"ok":true,"data":…}` /
  `{"ok":false,"error":"<machine code>","message":…}` (middleware; binary
  endpoints and the legacy `/health` alias stay unwrapped)
- `GET/PUT /api/settings` and `GET/PUT /api/protocols/{name}` replaced by
  `GET/PUT /api/config` (partial deep-merge; protocol sections still
  hot-toggle ONVIF/GB28181 immediately). `/api/protocols/runtime-status`
  remains as a device extension
- New: `/api/health` (public enveloped), `/api/status`, SPEC capability
  superset on `/api/capabilities` (host probe kept as `system` /
  `recommended_profiles` extension fields)
- `POST /api/auth/setup` now establishes a session (signs the new admin in)

**Changed** (frontend): the Preact SPA is replaced by the shared
**mibee-webui** vanilla ES Modules build (same UI as the Pi cameras,
capability-driven). Removed: `crates/web/build.rs` (esbuild bundling),
`package.json`, `static/src/`, dead `static/app.js`, Dockerfile
node/npm/esbuild steps — a fresh clone now builds with cargo alone.

### Fixed — GB28181 PS-over-RTP interop

PS muxer added; Gb28181Output rewritten from RFC-6184 to PS-over-RTP (PT=96); SSRC parsing fixed to use `y=` SDP field instead of `a=ssrc:`; Digest auth default changed from SHA-256 to MD5; Contact header fixed to use device IP; INVITE handler now sends 200 OK with device SDP answer.

### Added — GB28181 Catalog/DeviceInfo/Keepalive MESSAGE handling

MANSCDP+xml module; inbound MESSAGE dispatcher; keepalive heartbeat loop; device SDP answer with echoed SSRC on INVITE 200 OK.


### Changed — ffmpeg dependency fully removed (native codec stack)

All five former `ffmpeg` subprocess invocations have been replaced with
in-process Rust crates. **`ffmpeg` is no longer a runtime dependency** —
the Docker image, systemd service, and bare-metal install instructions
no longer require it. This eliminates per-source subprocess overhead
(~64 MB/camera), removes the noisy stderr log spam, and makes the
encoding pipeline crash-recoverable without process supervision.

| Former ffmpeg role | Replacement | Crate / module |
|--------------------|-------------|----------------|
| H.264 video encode (V4L2 → libx264 → Annex B) | OpenH264 (Cisco BSD-2) | `openh264` via `streaming::encoder::h264` |
| MJPEG → pixels decode | `jpeg-decoder` | `streaming::encoder::convert` |
| YUYV → JPEG (preview re-encode) | `jpeg-encoder` | `streaming::encoder::convert` |
| AAC audio encode | G.711 μ-law (default) / FDK-AAC (`aac` feature) | `streaming::encoder::audio` |
| MP4 segment muxing | `muxide` (pure-Rust fMP4) | `streaming::output::file` |
| JPEG snapshot (RTSP → 1 frame) | direct cache read from capture loop | `web::routes::streams::snapshot` |
| MJPEG live preview (RTSP → transcode) | JPEG broadcast subscription | `web::routes::streams::live_preview` |

**Architecture changes:**
- `VideoCaptureSource` re-activates the previously-disconnected
  `capture::video::VideoCapture` (nokhwa) path — the camera is now read
  natively via V4L2 in-process, frames converted to YUV420p, and encoded
  to H.264 via OpenH264. The `v4l2-ctl` capability-detection subprocess
  is also gone (nokhwa's `compatible_camera_formats()` is used instead).
- A JPEG tap is maintained in the capture loop: for MJPG cameras the
  raw JPEG bytes are forwarded zero-cost; for YUYV-only cameras a JPEG
  is re-encoded every Nth frame. The snapshot and live-preview endpoints
  consume this tap directly — no RTSP loopback, no transcoding.
- The `MediaFrame::Video` NAL-per-frame contract is preserved (start
  code stripped, `data[0] & 0x1f` is the NAL type), so the downstream
  protocol stack (RTSP/RTMP/GB28181/ONVIF) required **zero changes**.
- `AudioCaptureSource` now encodes i16 PCM to G.711 μ-law in-process
  (pure Rust, reuses `protocols::audio_codec`). AAC encoding is gated
  behind the new `aac` cargo feature (`fdk-aac`) for RTMP/MP4 audio
  compliance — off by default.
- `FileOutput` now uses `muxide` to write rolling MP4 segments directly,
  with no subprocess. Segment rotation happens at keyframe boundaries.
- Profile/level: Baseline, low complexity, GOP = 1 s — mirrors the old
  `libx264 -preset ultrafast -tune zerolatency -g 30` baseline.

**Cross-compile / deploy:** added `scripts/docker-build.sh`,
`scripts/deploy.sh`, `scripts/service.sh`, and four test scripts
(`test-smoke.sh`, `test-perf.sh`, `test-features.sh`, `soak-report.sh`)
to cross-compile from Windows via Docker and deploy to the two test
devices over SSH. See `scripts/README.md`.

### Fixed — MJPEG live preview corruption + camera view re-entry crash
- **MJPEG live preview corruption resolved** (horizontal tearing, green blocks, mosaic artifacts):
  - Root cause 1: ffmpeg capture command missing `-pix_fmt yuv420p` — pixel format mismatch caused decoder corruption.
  - Root cause 2: `-tune zerolatency` enabled sliced threading, producing 8 slice NALs per frame. Each slice incremented the RTP timestamp → 8× too fast (24000/frame instead of 3000), causing complete frame misalignment.
  - Root cause 3: SPS/PPS re-sent before every P-slice (8× per frame) flooded the broadcast channel, causing IDR frame fragments to be dropped.
  - Fix: added `-pix_fmt yuv420p` + `-threads 1` to force single-slice frames; RTP timestamp now only increments for slice NALs (types 1/5) per RFC 6184 §5.1; broadcast channel capacity increased 64→300.
- **Camera view re-entry crash fixed** ("Cannot set properties of null"): `_k` re-entry guard in router `r()` and `K()` prevents hashchange-triggered double-entry; `setText()` null-safe helper wraps all `textContent` assignments.

### Fixed — production hardening (security + reliability)
- **Mutex poisoning eliminated**: `resource.rs` and `rtsp_server.rs` now use `parking_lot::Mutex` (non-poisoning). Eliminates crash-on-panic cascade.
- **CSRF bypass on MJPEG endpoint fixed**: `server.rs` CSRF middleware now correctly covers all state-changing routes.
- **Crypto RNG hardened**: `thread_rng()` replaced with `OsRng` in all cryptographic code paths (session tokens, CSRF tokens).

### Added — Authoritative product positioning
- New [`docs/POSITIONING.md`](docs/POSITIONING.md) (bilingual zh/en) — authoritative product scope, target users, deployment model, capture scope, protocol scope, recording scope, security posture, observability, platform roadmap, UX requirements. **Any conflict between POSITIONING.md and other docs → POSITIONING.md wins.**
- Engineering guidance docs rewritten: added Product Scope, Platform Support, UX Requirements, Observability Stack, Security Posture sections; removed stale Architecture Mismatch Notes (those refactors are already done); accurate Project Status reflecting what is wired vs unwired vs missing.
- README.md Protocol Support Status table replaced with accurate component-level table: Auth no longer marked as stub (fully implemented); only RTSP is wired into runtime; RTMP/ONVIF/GB28181 marked as code-complete-but-not-wired; browser preview, local recording, i18n, theme, CSRF/CSP, remote log shipping, Windows/macOS all marked missing.

### Decision log (locked-in by product owner)
- **GB/T 28181**: retained as first-class protocol (2033 LOC implementation preserved; surfaced as same-tier toggle as ONVIF/RTMP/RTSP in Web UI).
- **Browser live preview**: in scope for v1 (MSE or JPEG sequence; WebRTC explicitly deferred).
- **NVR integration**: both pull (RTSP server) AND push (RTMP/GB28181) supported, all default-OFF, individually toggled via Web UI.
- **Local recording**: MP4 segment archive, configurable segment duration + total capacity + auto-prune-oldest, per-stream toggle.
- **Web UI security**: strong password + session + rate-limit + CSRF + CSP + login-failure lockout + HTTPS-mandatory. 2FA / mTLS explicitly out of scope for v1.
- **Platform**: Linux Tier 1 (only platform that compiles today); Windows v1.1, macOS v1.2 (planned, not blocking).

### Changed — Phase 1 P0 production blockers (5 of 6 resolved)
- **Hardcoded `localhost` eliminated**: new `[web] advertised_host` config option (empty = auto-detect LAN IP via UDP probe). All URL construction sites (RTSP base, snapshot, ONVIF XAddrs) now use the resolved host. Web UI no longer fabricates `rtsp://localhost:8554/...` fallbacks.
- **Mutex poisoning crash chain fixed**: `crates/security/src/rate_limit.rs` now uses `parking_lot::Mutex` (non-poisoning). `auth.rs` `SystemTime::now().unwrap()` calls replaced with `safe_epoch_secs()` helper that falls back to UNIX_EPOCH + logs error.
- **Rate limit now resets on successful login**: `login_handler` extracts client IP (X-Forwarded-For → X-Real-IP → fallback) and calls `reset_rate_limit` after bcrypt verify, so legitimate users don't get locked out after one typo.
- **Protocol configs persisted to SQLite**: new migration `002_protocol_configs.sql`. `routes/protocols.rs` rewritten to read/write DB (was in-memory `HashMap`, lost on restart). `main.rs` seeds DB from `config.toml` on first run only. Subsequent runs use persisted values — Web UI config changes now survive restart.
- **Protocol config type validation**: PUT handlers schema-validate per-protocol (onvif/gb28181/rtmp_push). Numeric fields (`port`, `register_interval_secs`, etc.) and booleans (`enabled`) sent as strings by legacy frontends are coerced. Unknown fields rejected with descriptive error.
- **RTMP push wired into StreamManager**: `StreamManager::create_stream` now reads `rtmp_push` config from DB; when `enabled=true` and `push_url` non-empty, auto-attaches `RtmpOutput` to the hub. `StreamInfo` exposes `rtmp_url` field. Toggle takes effect on next stream start (no server restart needed).
- **ONVIF + GB28181 startup reads DB**: `main.rs` now checks the `enabled` flag from SQLite (source of truth after first run) instead of `config.toml` only. Web UI toggles for these protocols now take effect on next server restart.

### Resolved — GB28181 RTP push + BYE cleanup + tracing instrumentation
- **GB28181 RTP push fully wired**: `Gb28181Output` is dynamically attached to the camera's `StreamHub` via `add_output_at_runtime` when a SIP INVITE arrives, and detached via `remove_output_from_stream` when BYE is received. The `HubHandle::remove_output` API was added to stop the output task and clean up. The `add_output_to_stream` race condition (take/replace pattern) was fixed by using `as_ref()` with a read lock.
- **OpenTelemetry span instrumentation added**: 132 `#[tracing::instrument]` annotations across all Axum HTTP handlers, StreamHub, StreamManager, capture pipeline (VideoCaptureSource/AudioCaptureSource), and protocol handlers (RTSP server, RTMP push, GB28181 SIP, ONVIF WS-Discovery/SOAP). The OTLP export pipeline now produces real trace data.

### Added — protocol hot-toggle, hot-plug, SSE, i18n, recording, and more
- **Protocol hot-toggle via Web UI**: `ProtocolRuntime` (`crates/web/src/protocol_runtime.rs`) starts/stops ONVIF, GB28181, and RTMP at runtime in response to Web UI toggles — **without server restart**. State persists across restarts via SQLite.
- **Hot-plug camera monitor**: udev netlink ADD/REMOVE listener auto-discovers plugged cameras and marks unplugged cameras offline (flushing their FileOutput gracefully).
- **SSE event bus**: `GET /api/events` (Server-Sent Events) pushes real-time camera add/offline events to the browser.
- **Snapshot endpoint**: `GET /api/cameras/{id}/snapshot` fully implemented — captures a JPEG frame via ffmpeg.
- **Browser live preview**: MJPEG multipart stream at `GET /api/cameras/{id}/live` — working end-to-end with single-slice frame fix.
- **i18n (zh-CN / en-US)**: full `t()` translation dictionary in `app.js`, language toggle persisted to user settings.
- **Day/night theme**: system-preference auto-detect on first run, manual toggle persisted.
- **Local recording**: `FileOutput` MP4 segment archive with configurable duration + capacity + auto-prune-oldest, per-stream toggle.
- **Remote log shipping**: optional `tracing-loki` layer (fail-open) via `[observability.logs]` config.
- **SQLite hybrid access**: sqlx pool (`web::db::init_pool`) for web CRUD + rusqlite (`init_auth_db`) for auth.
- **`advertised_host` config**: auto-detect LAN IP via UDP probe, no more hardcoded `localhost` in URLs.
- **W3C TraceContext propagation**: `traceparent` header extraction (incoming, Axum middleware) + injection (outbound HTTP requests).
- **esbuild build pipeline**: frontend bundled via esbuild for faster, smaller output.
- **4th migration** (`004__add_offline_since`): tracks when cameras went offline.

### Known gaps remaining
- **Windows / macOS compilation**: Do not compile yet (planned Tier 2). Blockers: `libc::getifaddrs` POSIX-only, `#[cfg(unix)]` without Windows fallback, hardcoded `/dev/videoN` paths.

### Changed — Brand rename
- **Rebranded from `notebook-cam` to `mibee-rec`** across all source, config, docs, and UI.
- Prometheus metric prefix changed: `notebook_cam_*` → `mibee_rec_*` (BREAKING for dashboards — update your Grafana queries).
- TLS dev certificate identity changed: `CN=notebook-cam` / `SAN=notebook-cam.local` → `CN=mibee-rec` / `SAN=mibee-rec.local` (delete old `tls/cert.pem` and `tls/key.pem` to regenerate).
- systemd service file renamed: `notebook-cam.service` → `mibee-rec.service`.
- Default `onvif.device_name`: `notebook-cam` → `mibee-rec`.
- RTSP Server realm and Server header: `notebook-cam` → `mibee-rec`.
- SIP User-Agent (GB28181): `notebook-cam/0.1` → `mibee-rec/0.1`.
- OpenTelemetry service name: `notebook-cam` → `mibee-rec`.

### Migration Steps
1. Update any Prometheus/Grafana queries referencing `notebook_cam_*` metrics.
2. Delete `tls/cert.pem` and `tls/key.pem` before restarting (new certs generated automatically).
3. If using systemd: `systemctl disable notebook-cam.service`, install `mibee-rec.service`, `systemctl enable --now mibee-rec.service`.
4. If using Docker: update container name and volume paths from `notebook-cam` to `mibee-rec`.
